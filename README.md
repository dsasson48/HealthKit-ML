# HealthKit ML
Bridging the Gap Between AI and Healthcare.

# Introduction
HealthKit ML aims to bring artifical intelligence to healthcare, one neural network at a time. With the recent advances in machine learning, or more specifically the successes garnered by deep learning algorithms in tasks such as computer vision and nature language processing (NLP), translating those achievements over to the medical field seems like a natural step in the right direction - with the intended hope of increasing the accuracy of diagnoses and the accessibility of healthcare overall.
