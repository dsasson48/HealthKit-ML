# Introduction
HealthKit ML aims to bring artifical intelligence to healthcare, one neural network at a time. With the recent advances in machine learning, or more specifically the successes garnered by deep learning algorithms in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), translating those achievements over to the medical field seems like a natural step in the right direction - with the intended hope of increasing the accuracy of diagnoses and the accessibility of healthcare overall.

### TB-Net: Tuberculosis Detection in Chest X-Rays 
#### Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. It is caused by the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_  bacterium (MTB), and spreads through airborne droplets from an infected person. While most infections do not have symptoms (latent tuberculosis), about 10% of cases progress to active disease which if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. Symptoms of active TB include chronic coughing with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

Despite the discovery of certain antibiotic drugs in the 1940s, TB has seen a resurgence due to increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In fact, one-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year, and around 1.37 million deaths per year (95% in developing countries).
